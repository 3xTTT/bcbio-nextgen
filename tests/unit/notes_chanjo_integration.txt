If you working on the chanjo integration, you can add this code snipet
to the main.py. That way you are only running chanjo. You will also
need to provide a valid bam file associated with the 'work_bam' key.

class ChanjoPipeline(AbstractPipeline):
    """ Test only: This pipeline only calls the coverage tool. It was designed solely
    to support integration with chanjo. Assumes the bam and bed files exist. 
    """
    name = "chanjo"

    @classmethod
    def run(self, config, config_file, parallel, dirs, samples):
        with prun.start(_wres(parallel, ["chanjo"]),
                        samples, config, dirs, "multicore") as run_parallel:
            with profile.report("coverage", dirs):
                samples[0][0]['work_bam'] = 'ready.bam'  # Todo: update with valid input
                samples = coverage.summary(samples, run_parallel)
        logger.info("Timing: finished")
        return samples
